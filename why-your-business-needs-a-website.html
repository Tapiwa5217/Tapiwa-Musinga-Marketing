        <p class="intro-text">Every small business today needs an online presence regardless of the industry they are in, whether or not they realize it. A social media presence isn’t enough, every business needs a website. 

            <span class="indent"></span>

           <br> It’s easy to think there’s no need to have a website if your business is already successful without one. A well designed and managed website could significantly impact a business’ reputation and the amount of revenue earned.
            
            <span class="indent"></span>

            <br> A website is no longer a luxury, it’s a necessity.
            If you’re not sure why a website is important for your business, here are 7 reasons:</p> 

<div class="article-points">

<h2>1. Legitimize your business.</h2>
<p> Before customers/clients trust you with their money, they want to be sure that your business is legitimate. <a href="https://blog.verisign.com/getting-online/verisign-2015-online-survey-97-percent-of-smbs-would-recommend-having-a-website-to-other-smbs/" target="_blank">84% of customers</a> will believe that your business is credible if you have a website.

    <span class="indent"></span> 

    <br> In most industries, there is a plethora of competitors offering the same products and services as your business. Having a website sets you apart from the crowd. It gives your business a more professional and trust worthy image.

    <span class="indent"></span> 

    <br> Certain features of a good website, such as a portfolio of previous work and testimonials from satisfied customers/clients, create trust and show that your business is credible. A business that communicates with customers/clients through social media messaging is unlikely to be taken seriously.
</p> 

<h2>2. Showcase your products and services</h2> 
<p> <a href="https://www.graffiti9.com/blog/website-importance-stats/" target="_blank">86% of website visitors</a> look for a company’s products/services on a business’ homepage. The number of customers looking for solutions online is ever increasing. 

    <span class="indent"></span>

    <br> A website gives you the opportunity to show your target customers what you can do to help them through pictures and giving them detailed information on the products and services you’re offering.
</p>  

<h2>3. Gain leads for your business</h2> 
<p> Every business has an ultimate goal of making a sale from their potential customers/clients. A website is an important tool for turning cold leads into paying customers/clients. A website can also be used to gain a customer’s contact information such as their email addresses for further marketing.
</p>  

<h2>4.An effective marketing tool</h2> 
<p> Posters and door to door marketing are no longer a reliable method of winning customers/clients. Every business needs an online marketing strategy which requires a website.
    
    <span class="indent"></span>

    <br> Social media campaigns are made effective by a landing page where customers/clients can take a desired action like giving their contact information or booking an appointment. Here’s an article about the <a href="qualities-of-a-good-website.html">qualities of an effective website.</a>  
</p> 
 
<h2>5. Gives you control over your customers</h2>
<p> Most businesses will choose to use social media platforms to showcase their products and services. The problem with that is social media posts don’t last long. After just 2 hours 30 minutes, your post will have made <a href="https://www.postplanner.com/lifespan-of-facebook-posts/" target="_blank">75% of its lifetime impressions</a>. 

    <span class="indent"></span>

    <br> The best way to gain control of your customers/clients is by having a website. With a website, it’s easier for customers to contact your business and you have control over what your customers/clients see. A website makes it possible for you to offer you potential customers/clients free valuable content in exchange for their contact information.</p> 

 <h2>6. Easier access to information</h2>
<p> Potential customers/clients want an experience that’s as simple as possible. They don’t want to look too far to find your contact details or hours of operation. With a website, your client/customers interaction with your business is made easier. All the information they need about your business is found in one place.
</p> 

<h2>7. Updates and announcements</h2>

<p>
    How do you inform customers/clients of promotions and changes with only social media platforms? Post about it every day? With a website, you can easily inform them of any updates or promotions and give them the opportunity to take advantage of them 24/7. Its more convenient and effective.
</p>
 
<h3>should I get a website?</h3>
<p>The definite answer is Yes.Without a website you’re missing out on a great opportunity to market your business and win customers/clients. Remember, if you don’t have a website today, your competitors do! 

    <span class="indent"></span>

    <br> The question you have is, “how do I get a website?” A simple website can easily be created through a CMS like wordpress and wix. If you want to avoid the burden of doing it yourself you can hire a web developer.
