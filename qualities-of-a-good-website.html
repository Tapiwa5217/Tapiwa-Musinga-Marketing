        </div>
       
        <p class="intro-text">Having a domain name and hosting is not all there is to having a website. The quality of the website matters as well. High quality websites are set up to achieve an intended goal for the business and to satisfy the website visitors in one way or the other.  

            <span class="indent"></span>

           <br> Every high quality website must have certain qualities that make the site more appealing, usable and well-functioning, have a higher ranking on search engines like Google and ultimately be of value to the site visitors.
            
            <span class="indent"></span>

            <br>Below are 5 major qualities that every reputable site should possess: </p> 

<div class="article-points">

<h2>1. Easily navigable</h2>
<p> Site visitors aren’t there to spend much time trying to figure out where things are. According to Google, <a href="https://www.graffiti9.com/blog/website-importance-stats/" target="_blank">61% of users</a> are unlikely to return to a site if they had trouble accessing it and 40% visit a competitor's site instead.

    <span class="indent"></span> 

    <br>  Each section and page of your website must be easy to navigate. If site visitors want to contact your business, it’s intuitive that they’ll look for a ‘contact us’ button on the top navigation bar. If visitors have a hard time trying to navigate parts of your website, they get frustrated and eventually leave.

</p> 

<h2>2. Mobile friendly</h2> 
<p>As of December 2021, <a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/platform-market-share/desktop-mobile-tablet/worldwide/" target="_blank">54.86 percent</a> of all web traffic came through mobile phones.  Having a website that’s not optimized for mobile is equivalent to chasing 54% of potential customers/clients that your business could have earned through your website.  

    <span class="indent"></span>

    <br>If your site isn’t mobile friendly, it becomes unusable on mobile devices as the site content will overlap each other creating an unpleasant experience. Mobile friendliness also affects your SEO ranking.
</p>  

<h2>3.	Well designed and functional</h2> 
<p> Your website must be both, well designed and fully functional. A study shows that <a href="https://www.graffiti9.com/blog/website-importance-stats/" target="_blank">94% of negative website feedback</a> was design related. The appearance of your website says a lot about your brand, therefore it must look professional and visually appealing. It also makes it easier for your clients to see the content you’re presenting to them when the content is spaced well with quality photos. 

    <span class="indent"></span>

    <br>Your styling should not be so distractive. The animations shouldn’t cause the website visitors to lose focus of the content you’re sharing with them. Be careful not to over style your website with fancy animations that could negatively affect the website functionality. Plain and simple is good enough.  
</p>  

<h2>4. Fast loading </h2> 
<p> Website visitors are very impatient where loading is concerned. <a href="https://www.websitebuilderexpert.com/building-websites/website-load-time-statistics/" target="_blank">40% of site visitors</a> will wait no more than three seconds before abandoning a site. Site visitors are in a rush to view whatever they are searching for. 
    
    <span class="indent"></span>

    <br>If your website is too slow, it creates a bad first impression and your site visitors will quickly move on to the next option, which is most likely your competitor. The amount of time it takes for your website to load also affects your <a href="https://cognitiveseo.com/blog/22865/page-speed-seo/" target="_blank">ranking on search engines</a>.
</p> 
 
<h2>5. Quality content</h2>
<p>All the other qualities mentioned would be of no benefit if the content you offer to your site visitors is of poor quality. The content is the main target when visiting a website. It may be to make a purchase or gain information. </a>. 

    <span class="indent"></span>

    <br> However, if the content has poor quality images or information that is of no use to the specific visitor, then the website will not fulfill its intended purpose. The content of a website must be of help to the visitor, it should speak to their needs and solve their problem otherwise the visitor will have no need to stay any longer. </p> 

    <h3>conclusion</h3>
<p>If your website is lacking any of these qualities, you’re losing valuable opportunities to sell your brand to potential customers/clients. Take some time to make adjustments to your website to make it of value to the site visitors. If you don’t know how to do it, you can hire a professional web developer/designer to do it for you.
